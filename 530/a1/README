Assignment #1, Hex/Binary File Dump
README

FileManifest: [testfiles: hello.txt, Test.txt] [source file: xbd.c] [output file: xbd.o] [makefile: makefile] [ReadMe: README]

Compile instructions: type in the command 'make xbd' into the command line

Operating Instructions: type in either the command 'xbd <filename>' or 'xbd -b <filename>'
for hex or binary dump.

Significant design decisions: a significant design decision I made over the course of completing this assignment was
making the temp string to hold all of the characters and sending that string to the printer function when full to print
all of the human readable characters. 

Extra Features: Error output if the argument input was done incorrectly, telling user the correct format.

Deficiencies: The only deficiency is that the characters wont be printed along the same column as the other charactes
if the number of bytes read on the last line does not equal to 6 if binary or 16 if hex.

Lessons Learned: I learned how to convert a character into its HEX and Binary form and gained in depth knowledge 
on the fact that you have to end strings with '\0' in C.
